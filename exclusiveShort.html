			<h2>The Life and Times of Demon</h2>
			</br>
			</br>
			<p>Once upon a time there was a peaceful town that bordered the sea. The town was lively and filled with unusual things brought from overseas. One day an odd person was brought from an far off distant land. The creature resembled a human except he had silky black hair, creamy ivory skin, and mysterious twilight purple eyes. The creature was unlike any human the towns people had ever seen; he was bewitchingly beautiful! Every day the creature would dance in the town plaza entertaining and capturing the hearts of the entire town. Soon the entire town was enchanted by this beautiful being. News of the handsome man spread far and wide and many came to see the dazzling dancer. A few months after the creatures arrival, even the king had heard of him! The king ordered the creature to come and dance for him at the palace. Now you see the creature was not human, he was a demon whose sole intention in life was to corrupt people with beauty and greed. The demon himself also wanted the kingdom to himself so the demon wasted no time in going to the castle. There he danced for king and his men and the king also fell victim to his enchanting dance. The demon's plan was almost complete! All he now needed to do was kill off the king. As he made his way to the bed chambers he came across the royal princess. The demon fell in love at first sight! He forgot all about the king an hastily made his way toward the princess.
			</p>
			<p>"Oh fair lady," he he exclaimed, "will you marry me?"</p>
			<p>The princess was surprised - The man whom the entire kingdom adored was proposing to her!</p>
			<p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I'm in love with another". The demon was taken aback! This woman had not only not been bewitched by him, but was in love with another. He was enraged! Who could have taken the heart of this human woman who he had wanted?! It was now a matter of pride.
			</p>
			<p>"I understand," he lied. "May I ask for the identity of the man who has taken the heart of a lady as fair as thee?" he asked.</p>
			<p>The princess was relieved, the beautiful man did not seem upset. "He is the crown prince of the neighboring kingdom," she exclaimed.</p>
			<p>"I wish you luck," the demon said with a smile and he left hastily for the neighboring kingdom.</p>
			<p>The neighboring kingdom was a vast kingdom. Unlike the kingdom that the demon had come from, it did not have a port, nor did it border the sea. The neighboring kingdom was technologically advanced and relied on computers to generate income. Upon reaching the castle, the demon was easily able to receive and audience with the king; after all, he WAS the rumoured dancer that had won the love of the "kingdom by the sea". Once he reached the castle, he danced for the king and his ministers, bewitching them instantly.</p>
			<p>"Your Majesty," the demon said after he had danced for the king, "I would like to meet you crown prince".</p>
			<p>The king complied and called for the crown prince. When the crown prince appeared before him the demon was surprised to see his brother on the throne. The older brother had killed the original crown prince and re-wrote the memories of the people around him. The demon was impressed but not about to let his brother win! That night he killed his brother and the king of the technologically advanced kingdom and took over. No one in the council opposed because the demon had enchanted them the night before. After taking his place as the emperor the demon sent a letter to the kingdom by the sea asking their king for the princess's hand in marriage. The king, who had previously been bewitched by the demon, complied eagerly. The princess was devastated - the man whom she had loved was murdered and she was marrying the one who had killed him. On the trip to the castle she bit her tongue and committed suicide to join her beloved in hell. The demon was devastated. Although he had killed his brother for his pride the woman whom he had loved had committed suicide. He was so sad that he neglected his duties as king and the empire was thrown into chaos. Not too long after the citizens rebelled and the demon was guillotined and sent to hell for all of his years of neglect. Once back in the comfort of hell, he went back to his family and celebrated his 99th success in corrupting the world with greed, chaos, and violence.</p>
